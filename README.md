# DDoS Attack Detection Model
#  (Cyber security and Machine learning Model)

## Problem Statement

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are a serious threat to network security, where multiple compromised systems are used to target a single system, causing it to become unavailable to its intended users. Detecting and mitigating such attacks is crucial to ensuring the stability and availability of network services.

## What is DDoS?

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) is a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. This is often achieved by using a large number of compromised devices (botnets) to send traffic to the target, thus causing it to become unreachable or sluggish for legitimate users.

## Solution

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting DDoS attacks in network traffic. By analyzing various features of network traffic packets, such as packet counts, flow duration, flag counts, and activity metrics, we can train models to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic.

## How it Occurs

DDoS attacks typically occur when attackers exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols or applications to gain control over a large number of devices, forming a botnet. These compromised devices are then instructed to flood the target server or network with traffic, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become inaccessible to legitimate users.

## Model Overview

We utilized various machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), K-Means Clustering, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to develop our DDoS detection model. After extensive experimentation and evaluation, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 99% on our model.
